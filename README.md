# PizzaRestaurantWebsiteWithHTMLAndCSS
 The restaurant website I developed to reinforce my HTML-CSS course project.
This project depicts a pizza restaurant website. It includes a navigation menu, the name of the restaurant, and a featured image on the homepage. The navigation menu contains links to the menu, about, and contact pages. Additionally, there are sections that showcase the history and features of the restaurant. The footer of the page includes a copyright notice.

The HTML and CSS code of this project create the design for a pizza restaurant website.
